# SensorMonitoringSystem
The sensor monitoring system consists of sensor nodes measuring the room temperature, a sensor gateway that acquires all sensor data from the sensor nodes, and an SQL database to store all sensor data processed by the sensor gateway. A sensor node uses a private TCP connection to transfer the sensor data to the sensor gateway. The SQL database is an SQLite system. 

It is the source code of final assignment of course System Software in Campus GroepT of KU Leuven. Additional memory layout is also included.
